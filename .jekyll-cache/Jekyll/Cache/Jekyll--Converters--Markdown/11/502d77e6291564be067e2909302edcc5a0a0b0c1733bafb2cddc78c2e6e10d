<i>How Shannon's Demon works...</i><br /><br />Let's start with a portfolio worth 1000 USD and trade BNBUSDT (<b>market</b>). To start perfectly balanced we need to buy 500 USDT (<b>quote_asset_qty = 500.0</b>) and 500 USDT / 20 BNBUSDT = 25 BNB (<b>base_asset_qty = 25.0</b>) . The price at which we are perfectly balanced (20 BNBUSDT) is called the equilibrium price.
</p>
<p>T0: 500 USDT + 25 BNB x 20 BNBUSDT = 1000 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
At time T1 the price decreases to 15 BNBUSDT. Total value is now equal to 875 USDT and in order to be perfectly balanced we need to have 437.5 USDT and 437.5 / 15 = 29.17 BNB. Hence we buy 29.17 - 25 = 4.17 BNB.
</p>
<p>T1: 437.5 USDT + 29.17 BNB x 15 BNBUSDT = 875 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
At time T2 the price increases back to 20 BNBUSDT. Total value is now equal to 1020.8 USDT and in order to be perfectly balanced we need to have 510.4 USDT and 510.4 / 20 = 25.52 BNB. Hence we sell 29.17 - 25.52 = 3.65 BNB.
</p>
<p>T2: 510.42 USDT + 25.52 BNB x 20 BNBUSDT = 1020.8 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
As you can see in the above example we have generated a small retrun of approximately 2%. In the above example we ignored fees and the bot can buy or sell at the mid. Over time the bot generates many of these small returns which are immediately re-invested. As you can see your portfolio gains from volatility or, in other words, heavy price fluctuations. Ideal for the highly volatile crypto currency space.

<i>How the bot works...</i><br /><br />
The example above is a simplified explanation of how the bot actually works. The following steps are repeated over and over again until the bot is killed. The executable is started by double clicking it. 
<br /><br />   
1. Cancel all orders. Only orders that were send by your bot are cancelled. Sleep for <b>sleep_seconds_after_cancel_orders</b> seconds.<br /><br /> 
2. Process all new trades. Quantities, base qty and quote qty, and <b>fromId</b> are updated. Only trades with id &gt; <b>fromId</b> and trades that were ordered by your bot are processed. <i>Make sure fromId is always set to 0 if you add a new market to the config file.</i><br /><br /> 
3. Send orders. If more than <b>rebalance_interval_sec</b> seconds have passed since last send orders, special orders are send. If not regular orders are send. Sleep for <b>sleep_seconds_after_send_orders</b> seconds.<br /><br />
Regular orders have a price equal to the equilibrium price multiplied by <b>buy_percentage</b> and <b>sell_percentage</b>. For market BNBUSDT, percentages 0.75 and 1.25 and asset quantities 400 and 16.17, like in above config picture, order prices become (400.0 / 16.17) x 0.75 = 18.5529 and (400.0 / 16.17) x 1.25 = 30.9215. You can see these prices (p:) in the bot picture above. The buy quantity (q:) becomes ((0.5 x (400 + 16.7 x 18.5529)) - 16.7 x 18.5529) / 18.5529 = 2.70. Likewise for the sell order.
<br /><br />
Special orders make the bot rebalance at the current mid (l:) but only if the mid is more than 5% away from the equilibrium price. In the above bot picture you can see that market BNBUSDT is -10.2% (b: or s:) away from equilibrium price. Hence the bot dimes the best bid at 22.2151. The sell order becomes a regular order. Quantities (q:) are calculated like the example given above.
<br /><br />
Before the bot follows the above steps, the bot shows DUMMY orders and asks if you want to continue. This way you can check prices. Usually when the price move (b: or s:) shows a large percentage, an error in base and quote quantities or fromId has been made.</p>
