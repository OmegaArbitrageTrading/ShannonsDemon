<i>How Shannon's Demon works...</i><br /><br />Let's start with a portfolio worth 1000 USD and trade BNBUSDT (<b>market</b>). Since we have to start with a perfectly balanced portfolio, we buy 500 (<b>quote_asset_qty</b>) USD worth of USDT and 500 USD worth of BNB. At a current price of of 20 BNBUSDT that is 25 (<b>base_asset_qty</b>) BNB. 20 BNBUSDT is also called the equilibrium price for quantities 500 USDT and 25 BNB.
</p>
<p>T0: 500.0 USDT + 25.00 BNB x 20.0 BNBUSDT = 1000.0 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
At T1 the price decreases to 15.0 BNBUSDT and to be perfectly balanced again the bot buys 4.17 BNB in exchange for 62.5 USDT.
</p>
<p>T1: 500.0 USDT + 25.00  BNB x 15.0 BNBUSDT = 875.0 USDT.<br />
T1: Rebalance: buy 4.17 BNB.<br />
T1: 437.5 USDT + 29.17 BNB x 15.0 BNBUSDT = 875.0 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
At T2 the price increases to 20.0 BNBUSDT and to be perfectly balanced again the bot sells 3.65 BNB in exchange for 72.92 USDT.
</p>
<p>T2: 437.50 USDT + 29.17 BNB x 20.0 BNBUSDT = 1020.8 USDT.<br />
T2: Rebalance: sell 3.65 BNB.<br />
T2: 510.42 USDT + 25.52 BNB x 20.0 BNBUSDT = 1020.8 USDT.</p>
<p align="justify">
As you can see in the above example we have generated a small retrun of approximately 2%. Over time the bot generates many small returns which are immediately re-invested (similar to receiving compound interest). This is also known as volatility harvesting and if there is plenty of something in the crypto space, it is volatility.

<i>How the bot works...</i><br />
The example above is a simplified explanation of how the bot actually works. The bot starts with showing DUMMY orders. Usually if the last price deviates too much from the equilibrium price, the base and/or quote asset quantities in the config file are not enterd correctly. In the picture above the last price (l:) for market ETCUSDT = 7.2556 and it deviates -7.3% (s: or b:) from equilibrium price. The next steps are repeated until the program is killed.<br /> 
First regular orders that have a price equal to the equilibrium price multiplied by <b>buy_percentage</b> and <b>sell_percentage</b> are send. For market ETCUSDT the equilibrium price = 7.82755 and hence we send a buy order with price 5.8707 (p:) and a sell order with price 9.7844 (p:). Quantities (q:) are calculated based on the BNBUSDT example above.<br /> 
After waiting <b>sleep_seconds_after_send_orders</b> seconds, the bot cancels all open orders and waits another <b>sleep_seconds_after_cancel_orders</b> seconds. It then processes all new trades subject to trade id &gt; <b>fromId</b> and given that the order was generated by your bot.<br />
P.S. Every time the bots wants to send regular orders, it checks if <b>rebalance_interval_sec</b> seconds have passed since last check. If so, instead of sending regular orders the bot sends special orders. These special orders rebalance at the current price only if the current price is more than 5% away from equilibrium. For market ETCUSDT we send a buy order with price 7.2529 and quantity 1.67.

<p><i>Debugging…<br /></i> Most error messages are self explanatory. However we want to mention all messages related to time sync. This means that the time of your computer is not in sync with the time of Binance’s servers. Sync your system’s clock in order to solve it. We have also seen that the time of the router needed to be synced. For more information you can search <a href="https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md">Binance rest-api documentation</a>. The bot uses Samm Chardy’s <a href="https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-binance</a> library. You can look there also. Don’t hesitate to contact us for any help.</p>
